### Analysis of Hottest Topics in ML Research

##### Project Description
[Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/) (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, you will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

##### Insights
Application of **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** algorithm to extract and visualise recent Machine Learning Research topics. Generation of word-cloud from latest trending topics and trend visualisation.

##### Dataset
Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in datasets/papers.csv. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.
_The dataset has been intentionally kept private. Apologies for inconvenience._

##### Collaboration
Open to suggestion, issues, collaborations and PRs.<br> Please be kind, I am just a beginner. :-)
